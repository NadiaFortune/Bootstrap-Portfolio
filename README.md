 **Bootstrap Portfolio**

## **Description**

I created a Portfolio page to start to showcase the work I'e created since starting as a front-end developer.

The desired outcome was to have a simple one-page facility that would host a small selection of work for potential clients or employers to view, and contact me via the form or other contact links and telephone number.

The index.html code is based on Bootstrap (4 & 5) base code and amended to suit my requirements in respect of design and layout.

I aimed to include semantic HTML elements throughout and to ensure all links could be followed correctly.

The 'See It' buttons in the Work section also don't have content at present. This will be updated as new projects are created.

The 'Submit' button in the form doesn't have a target attribute, as there is currenty no form host to send to.

The use of Bootstrap has also minimised the need for more media queries than necessary.

The following images show screenshots of the deployed page/:

The following resources were used for the required code changes in the index.html and style.css files:

Base code was sourced via Bootstrap 4 & 5.
